# ATM
This Java program simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system with a graphical user interface (GUI).

The GUI utilizes Swing components to provide a user-friendly interface for operations such as balance inquiry, withdrawal, transfer, and password change. The program supports both English and Persian languages for user interaction. Each stage of the ATM operation is represented by a separate panel, enhancing modularity and readability.

Please note that this program focuses solely on the GUI and interface aspects; it does not include actual functionality for banking operations.

It was originally created as an assignment for Advanced Programming course at _Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)_.
